## TLDR

- Lemmy is like Reddit but decentralized
- Lemmy ["instances" (or servers)](https://lemmyverse.net/) host subreddits ([called communities](https://lemmyverse.net/communities))
  - They also provide users a home for their account
- They're all [connected](https://lemmymap.feddit.de/) to each other through [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/)
- You can post to OTHER servers from your HOME server with ONE account
- Instances (normally) vouch that others are safe though [Fediseer](https://gui.fediseer.com/instances/safelisted)
- Please see additional documentation in the sidebar to learn more ðŸ’—
